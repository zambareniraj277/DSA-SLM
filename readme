🤖 AI Guru – SLM-Powered Quiz Generation System

AI Guru is a local AI-powered educational platform that generates and delivers Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) multiple-choice questions using a Small Language Model (SLM) combined with dataset-based retrieval.
The system is designed for offline execution, data privacy, and fast response time, making it ideal for academic and low-resource environments.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional AI learning platforms rely on cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which introduce challenges such as high cost, latency, and privacy concerns.
AI Guru addresses these issues by leveraging a locally deployed Small Language Model (TinyLlama-1.1B) integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

The application is built using Streamlit and allows users to:

Select difficulty level and topic

Fetch pre-stored questions from a dataset

Generate new AI-based quiz questions dynamically

View correct answers with explanations

🧠 Key Features

✅ Local AI inference (No API / No Internet required)

✅ Small Language Model (TinyLlama-1.1B)

✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

✅ Difficulty-wise and topic-wise question generation

✅ CPU & GPU auto-detection

✅ Clean and interactive UI using Streamlit

✅ Educational & privacy-friendly architecture

⚙️ How the Project Works
1️⃣ User Interaction

User logs into the system

Selects difficulty level (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Selects a DSA topic

2️⃣ Dataset-Based Retrieval

The system loads a structured CSV dataset containing:

Questions

Difficulty levels

Topics

Correct answers

Explanations

A random question can be fetched directly from the dataset for practice.

3️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

When the user chooses “Generate New AI Question”:

A relevant example question is retrieved from the dataset

This example is added as context to the prompt

The prompt is passed to the local SLM

This improves:

Accuracy

Topic relevance

Question quality

4️⃣ Small Language Model (SLM) Inference

Model Used: TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat

Runs locally on:

GPU (if available)

CPU (fallback mode)

Uses Hugging Face transformers pipeline

Generates:

New question

4 options

Correct answer

Short explanation

5️⃣ Output Parsing & Display

The AI output is parsed into structured fields

Displayed cleanly in the UI

Answer and explanation are hidden under an expandable section
